#Remembering Lynching: A Digital Memorial

## Abstract
A [physical memorial](http://eji.org/news/eji-announces-plans-to-build-museum-and-national-lynching-memorial) for the victims of lynching is in the works, and a schema for a [memorial reading](http://journals.sagepub.com.ezproxy.gc.cuny.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/2332649215583841) has been developed by some educators. Utilizing data on lynching in the postbellum South made available by sociologists, I propose the creation of a tool that announces the anniversaries of victim's killings as a mode to spread awareness about this dark chapter of U.S. history. The project will create or utilize an existing online archive of available materials on known lynching victims, develop a script to summarize information and a link to more materials, and feed this to other platforms, such as a webpage, social media, and/or an embedded text box that can be incorporated on other websites. 

## Deliverables
1. A complete, web-integrated collection of records of individual lynching victims that contains available information such as:
  1. the location, time, and date of the lynching
  1. the race, age, occupation, and family status of the victim
  1. any information on the mob (usually only race)
  1. materials such as newspaper articles, essays, books, or perhaps, photographs that describe the lynching
1. A script that compares the current date with dates of past lynchings and returns all matching records
1. A script that pulls information from the record and creates a statement in English 
1. A means by which to publicize the memorial
